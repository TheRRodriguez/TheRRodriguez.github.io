    <h4>Summer Events: June</h4>
    <p>June has been a busy month for Troop 777. On the 1st we had a service project at Batiquitos Lagoon and got to use a log splitter to cut the Eucalyptus logs to a size the BLF can sell for their fundraiser and gathered brush and weeds from around the Lagoon. June 3rd was our Ice Cream Social and Court of Honor. We kicked off our summer meetings on Monday, June 10th by pummeling the scoutmaster with water balloons and having the Troop Swim at one of our regular meeting places. Thanks to Mrs. Neuman for getting us into such a great pool to start the outdoor summer meetings. There was a watermelon toss and I think a few boys may have woke up a little sore after getting really enthusiastic about tossing and catching those big ones. On June 15th, we had a service project for the NRA at their Family Shooting Sports Camp at the Lemon Grove Rod and Gun Club. The scouts helped in the parking lot, did a flag ceremony to start the camp, and had a chance to shoot after all their work had been done.  We have a couple backpacking trips on the calendar for June, summer camp is just around the corner, and those outdoor summer meetings continue on Mondays at 6:30 pm. Get out there and have fun!</p>
